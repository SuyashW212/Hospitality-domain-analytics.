 Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing revenue management and customer satisfaction for Atliq using data-driven insights. The dashboard provides key analytics to enhance pricing strategies, occupancy rates, and online booking revenue.

🔹 Key Insights
1️⃣ Dynamic Pricing Strategy Needed 🎯

Occupancy fluctuates, impacting RevPAR, but ADR remains constant, leading to flat pricing.
Implementing dynamic pricing (weekend vs. weekday rates) can optimize ADR and boost RevPAR.
2️⃣ Addressing Low-Performing Hotels 🏨

Example: Atliq Grands Bangalore has the lowest occupancy.
Using the Pareto Principle, 20% of underperforming properties drive 80% of negative reviews.
Guest review analysis helps in resolving key issues like room location, amenities, and service quality.
3️⃣ Boosting Online Booking Revenue 🌐💰

Online channels generate less revenue compared to offline.
Instead of reducing direct pricing, offering discount coupons can increase online bookings and revenue.
